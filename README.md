# fluid-tw-script
This is a custom script to make fluid tw work for some utility classes for now until TW v4 support

The created css file needs to be imported in your tailwind css file.
`@import "./generated-fluid.css";`

Paths, utility maps, etc. need to be adapted for your needs / project / framework - currently it works for me for my astro project.
